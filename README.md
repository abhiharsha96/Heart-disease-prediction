# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using a machine learning model. The dataset used includes various medical attributes that are known to be significant indicators of heart health. By analyzing this data, the model can help in identifying individuals who might be at risk of heart disease.

## Key Features

- Utilizes a comprehensive dataset of patient medical history and clinical information.
- Employs machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease risk.
- Provides visualizations to better understand the data distribution and model performance.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The project uses a dataset containing medical information such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Data is cleaned and prepared for analysis. This involves handling missing values, normalizing data, and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Model Training**: Various machine learning models are trained on the dataset, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.
4. **Evaluation**: The models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best-performing model.
5. **Prediction**: The final model is used to predict the risk of heart disease for new patients based on their medical data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to preprocess data, train the model, and make predictions.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a tool for medical professionals to identify potential heart disease risks in patients early on, enabling timely interventions and better patient care.
